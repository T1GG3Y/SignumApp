# Current Task: Voice Recording App - Firebase Authentication Implementation

## Status: Testing Firebase Authentication

### Completed:
1. ✅ Created complete voice recording app with all screens
2. ✅ Implemented local storage for recordings
3. ✅ Added Firebase configuration
4. ✅ Implemented Firebase authentication service
5. ✅ Added Firebase Storage for audio uploads
6. ✅ Created auth flow with email/password
7. ✅ Added debug information to Profile screen
8. ✅ Fixed Firebase initialization issues

### Current Focus:
- Testing Firebase authentication and audio upload functionality
- The app now supports both local storage (demo mode) and Firebase cloud storage

### Firebase Features Implemented:
1. **Authentication**:
   - Email/password sign in and sign up
   - Auth state persistence with AsyncStorage
   - Fallback to local demo mode if Firebase unavailable

2. **Cloud Storage**:
   - Audio files upload to Firebase Storage
   - Organized by user ID and date
   - Metadata saved to Firestore
   - Automatic sync when signed in

3. **Debug Information**:
   - Profile screen shows Firebase connection status
   - Console logs for upload progress
   - Clear error messages for troubleshooting

### Testing Instructions:
- See `userInstructions/test-firebase-auth.md` for detailed testing steps
- Check Profile tab for Firebase connection status
- Use "Sign In" (not "Continue as Guest") to test Firebase auth
- Monitor console logs during audio recording for upload status

### Known Issues:
- Firebase auth initialization warnings in console (non-blocking)
- These warnings don't affect functionality

### Next Steps:
- User should test Firebase authentication
- Verify audio uploads to Firebase Storage
- Check Firebase Console for uploaded files
